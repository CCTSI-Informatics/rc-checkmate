# CCTSI-Informatics/RC-CheckMate

CheckMate is a Microsoft Excel macro developed to identify areas in a REDCap database data dictionary that do not conform with applicable best practice guidelines.  CheckMate recommendations are made by searching for common words (e.g.. date, phone, email) and matching these words to a guideline. 

CheckMate rules focus on three areas: (1) identifying protected health information (PHI), (2) identifying variables labeled as free form text that could be categorized to a particular type of text (e.g. date, number) and (3) setting expected minimum/maximum values on specific data types (lab values, dates, etc). 

To use: open CheckMate and then open your data dictionary.  Press Cntl-q to run
